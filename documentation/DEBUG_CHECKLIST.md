## üîç Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd src/backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm start
```

### Step 2: Verify MongoDB Connection
Check backend console for:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB Atlas Connected Successfully
Database: wing-hobbies
```

### Step 3: Login to Admin
- URL: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
- Email: admin@winghobbies.com
- Password: admin123

### Step 4: Add Product to Today's Deals
1. Go to "Today's Deals" in admin sidebar
2. Find a product in the table
3. Click "Add to Deals" button
4. Should see alert: "Added to Today's Deals!"
5. Badge should change to yellow "Featured"

### Step 5: Verify on Homepage
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Check left sidebar
3. Should see "Today's Deals" section
4. Featured product should appear with image, name, price

### Step 6: Test Persistence
1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. Featured product should still be there
3. Go to admin panel - featured count should be same
4. Close browser and reopen - data should persist

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Featured count shows 0 after refresh
**Cause**: Using local MongoDB instead of Atlas
**Fix**: Check .env has MongoDB Atlas URI, restart backend

### Issue: Product not appearing in sidebar
**Cause**: Frontend not fetching or filtering correctly
**Fix**: Check browser console for errors, verify API response

### Issue: "Failed to update product" error
**Cause**: Token expired or missing
**Fix**: Re-login to admin panel

### Issue: Changes not saving to database
**Cause**: runValidators blocking partial updates
**Fix**: Already fixed - runValidators set to false

## üìä Database Verification

Check MongoDB Atlas directly:
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Login to winghobbies cluster
3. Browse Collections > wing-hobbies > products
4. Find product and check `featured: true`

## üîß Quick Fixes

### Clear Everything and Start Fresh
```javascript
// Browser Console (F12)
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Check API Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Get all products
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products

# Check featured products
curl http://localhost:5000/api/products | grep "featured"
```

### Force Update Product
```javascript
// Browser Console - Update product directly
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/products/PRODUCT_ID', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ featured: true })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log);
```

## ‚ú® Expected Behavior

1. Admin adds product to Today's Deals
2. Product's `featured` field updates to `true` in MongoDB Atlas
3. User sidebar fetches products where `featured = true`
4. Product appears in "Today's Deals" section
5. Data persists across refreshes and browser sessions
6. Admin can remove product by clicking "Remove" button
7. Product disappears from user sidebar immediately
