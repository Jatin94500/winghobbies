## 🐛 IDENTIFIED ISSUES & FIXES

### CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. ⚠️ DUPLICATE .ENV FILES
**Issue**: Two .env files with different MongoDB URIs
- `/src/backend/.env` - Has correct Atlas URI with credentials
- `/.env` - Has old Atlas URI with different credentials

**Impact**: Confusion about which database is being used

**Fix Applied**: 
```bash
# Use /src/backend/.env (already correct)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://winghobbies_admin:j0OhWb9d9XLQykLb@winghobbies.mzduv50.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=winghobbies
```

**Action Required**: Delete root `/.env` file to avoid confusion

---

#### 2. ⚠️ BACKEND SERVER NOT STARTING
**Issue**: Users see CORS errors because backend isn't running

**Root Cause**: Backend must be manually started

**Fix**: Created startup scripts
- `start-backend.bat` - Windows batch file
- `START_HERE.md` - Clear instructions

**Verification**: 
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"OK","message":"Wing Hobbies API is running"}
```

---

#### 3. ⚠️ MOCK DATA STILL EXISTS
**Issue**: Mock data files in `src/user/data/` directory

**Files Found**:
- banners.js
- categories.js
- offers.js
- orders.js
- products.js
- reviews.js
- vouchers.js

**Impact**: Confusion - these files are NOT used anymore

**Status**: ✅ All components now use real API calls

**Recommendation**: Delete entire `src/user/data/` folder

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 4. ⚠️ DUPLICATE ROUTE FILES
**Issue**: Multiple route files for same resources

**Found**:
- `routes/products.js` ✅ (ACTIVE - being used)
- `routes/productRoutes.js` ❌ (UNUSED)
- `routes/orders.js` ✅ (ACTIVE)
- `routes/orderRoutes.js` ❌ (UNUSED)
- `routes/userRoutes.js` ❌ (UNUSED)

**Action Required**: Delete unused route files to avoid confusion

---

#### 5. ⚠️ DUPLICATE PAGE COMPONENTS
**Issue**: Multiple page files for same functionality

**Found**:
- `pages/Login.js` ✅ (ACTIVE)
- `pages/LoginPage.js` ❌ (UNUSED)
- `pages/Register.js` ✅ (ACTIVE)
- `pages/RegisterPage.js` ❌ (UNUSED)
- `pages/Profile.js` ✅ (ACTIVE)
- `pages/ProfilePage.js` ❌ (UNUSED)
- `pages/About.js` ✅ (ACTIVE)

- `pages/CheckoutPage.js` ❌ (UNUSED)
- `pages/ProductDetail.js` ✅ (ACTIVE)
- `pages/ProductPage.js` ❌ (UNUSED)

**Action Required**: Delete all *Page.js duplicates

---

#### 6. ⚠️ UNUSED BACKEND FILES
**Issue**: Extra files not being used

**Found**:
- `backend-server.js` ❌ (server.js is used)
- `upload-local.js` ❌ (upload.js with GCS is used)

**Action Required**: Delete unused files

---

### LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

#### 7. ℹ️ MISSING ADMIN CREATION SCRIPT
**Issue**: No easy way to create first admin user

**Found**: `createAdmin.js` exists but needs to be run manually

**Solution**: Document the process
```bash
cd src/backend
node createAdmin.js
```

---

#### 8. ℹ️ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE INCONSISTENCY
**Issue**: Some env vars have different names

**Found**:
- `JWT_SECRET` vs `JWT_SECRET` (consistent ✅)
- `MONGODB_URI` (consistent ✅)
- `PORT` (consistent ✅)

**Status**: Actually consistent, no issue

---
